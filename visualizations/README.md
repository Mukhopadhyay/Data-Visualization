### `visualizations` directory

Welcome to the visualization directory, this is where you add your code. If you find the category in which you're trying to
contribute to then perfect, you're almost there. All you'd have to do now is to add your code in a cell with proper documentation
and save the file.

If you don't find the category of visualization in this directory, you can simply go ahead and create a directory with the kind name of the visualization.
Be sure to use the same naming convention as you see here please. So for example, if you'd like to add piechart and don't see it here, create a directory called
e.g., `Piechart`
